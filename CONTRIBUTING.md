## Adding a data platform

Support for new database platforms (beyond built-in DuckDB and optional Snowflake) will be documented here. For now, see [docs/specs](docs/specs/) and the platform registry in the agent package for the extension pattern. A dedicated "Adding a platform" section with steps and acceptance criteria is planned.

## Specs and design

- Specifications: [docs/specs](docs/specs/)
