# Interpret Results

Read the assessment report and present results in a clear, conversational way. Walk through by factor and target workload (L1/L2/L3). Triage failures with the user so they can decide what to fix and what to accept.

## Forbidden Actions

- NEVER execute remediation — only suggest
- NEVER invent scores or results; use the report as source of truth
- NEVER skip triage when the user expects to decide what to fix

## When to Load

- After assess; user has a report (file or from last run)
- User wants to understand what passed/failed and why

## Prerequisites

- Report available (JSON or markdown). Get it from: (1) the report file or path from the last assess step, (2) or if the user has a saved assessment, load by id: `aird report --id <id> -o markdown` or `-o json:path/to/report.json`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Lead with Target Level

If the user stated a target workload (L1, L2, or L3) in the interview, start there. For example: "Your data scores X% for L2 (RAG) readiness. Here's what's holding you back."

Summarize: total tests, pass counts or percentages at L1/L2/L3 from the report summary.

### Step 2: Factor-by-Factor Walkthrough

For each factor that has failures (or low scores) at the user's target level, briefly explain what the factor means using the framework:

- **Clean:** [factors/factor-00-clean.md](../../factors/factor-00-clean.md)
- Contextual, Consumable, Current, Correlated, Compliant: factor docs in [factors/](../../factors/) (add as they exist)

Then list the failing tests for that factor (e.g. test_id, requirement, measured value vs threshold). Don't dump the full report; summarize and highlight.

### Step 3: Failure Triage (Phase 3 Interview)

**Load** [interview/SKILL.md](../interview/SKILL.md) (Phase 3: post-results)

For the main failures, ask the user:

- "Is this expected?" (e.g. high null rate on an optional column)
- "Do you want me to suggest a fix?"
- "Should we exclude this from future assessments?" (when context supports exclusions)

Record their decisions so you can generate fixes only for what they want to address.

**STOP:** Get user decisions before generating remediation suggestions.

### Step 4: Gaps and Limitations

If the report includes a `not_assessed` section (when present), explain what couldn't be assessed and why. Ask if they can provide missing inputs (e.g. additional metadata) if relevant.

## Output

- User understands scores and failures at their target level
- User has decided which failures to fix vs accept
- Ready to proceed to [remediate/SKILL.md](../remediate/SKILL.md) for fix suggestions
