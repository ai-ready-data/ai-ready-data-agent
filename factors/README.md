# Factors of AI-ready data

This directory contains the factor documents for the AI-Ready Data Framework. Each factor defines what "AI-ready" means for one dimension of the data layer, with requirements and stack capabilities per workload (L1/L2/L3).

**Spec:** Factor documents conform to [docs/specs/factor-spec.md](../docs/specs/factor-spec.md) (abstract shape, requirement keys, workloads).
