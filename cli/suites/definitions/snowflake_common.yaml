# Composed Snowflake suite: merges all 6 factors for comprehensive assessment.
# The Snowflake platform adapter registers with default_suite="common_snowflake",
# so this composed suite is what gets used by default for Snowflake assessments.
#
# Factors included:
#   0. Clean - Data quality (nulls, duplicates, format consistency)
#   1. Contextual - Semantic context (PKs, FKs, temporal columns)
#   2. Consumable - Accessibility (documentation, clustering, search)
#   3. Current - Freshness (change tracking, streams, data age)
#   4. Correlated - Lineage (tags, provenance, traceability)
#   5. Compliant - Governance (masking, row access, sensitivity)
#
# Reference: /factors.md for factor definitions
